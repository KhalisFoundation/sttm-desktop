### <a name="how-to-search">How do I search for a shabad?</a>

After launching SikhiToTheMax, by default you can search for a shabad by entering the first letter of each word. For example, if the shabad is `ਗੁਰੁ ਮੇਰੈ ਸੰਗਿ ਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਨਾਲੇ`, you would enter `gmsshn`. ![](./assets/img/help_images/search_example.gif)

### <a name="type-in-gurmukhi">How do I type in Gurmukhi?</a>

When using SikhiToTheMax, your keyboard will automatically type in Gurmukhi. Reference the keyboard map below to know which character goes with which key. Alternatively, you can click on the Gurmukhi keyboard icon and type in the letters manually.![](./assets/img/help_images/web-desktop-keyboard-map.png)

### <a name="adjust-font-size">How can I adjust the font size?</a>

The easiest way to change the font size is through quick tools. The quick tools menu is available in the preview pane when you are viewing a shabad. ![](./assets/img/help_images/desktop-quick-tools.gif)

### <a name="background-color">How do I change the background color?</a>

After launching SikhiToTheMax, click the icon for Themes and choose your preferred option. Alternatively, you can scroll to the bottom and upload a custom background image. We recommend a resolution of 1920x1080 for custom backgrounds.

### <a name="search-type">What do the different search types do?</a>

- First Letter (Start)

  - The letters you input must be from the START of a line in a shabad.

- First Letter (Anywhere)

  - The letters you input can be from any part of the line. For example, you can start your search by typing in the first letter of every word in the second half of a shabad’s line.

- Full Word (Gurmukhi)

  - You can type in the full word(s) in gurmukhi that you are searching for.

- English Translation (Full Word)

  - You can search for shabads via the english translations. For example, type in the word "bird" and the results will show all shabads that include a translation for "bird".

### <a name="wildcard">Using wildcard when searching</a>

If you are unsure of a letter when searching, you can enter in a `*` as a wildcard search operator. This will act as a placeholder and will find results against every letter. For example, if the shabad is ਗੁਰੁ ਮੇਰੈ ਸੰਗਿ ਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਨਾਲੇ , you can enter `gms*hn`.

### <a name="connect-to-projector">How do I connect SikhiToTheMax to a projector?</a>

Plug in your computer to the projector or TV. Once you do this, go to your computer's display settings and change it to "Extended Desktop" (NOT mirroring). After that, launch SikhiToTheMax and turn on "Presenter View" in the settings! ![](./assets/img/help_images//desktop-extend-pc.png) ![](./assets/img/help_images/desktop-extend-mac.png)

### <a name="larivaar">Can you view the Gurbani in Larivaar?</a>

Yes! After launching SikhiToTheMax, click the icon for Display Settings, and choose the Larivaar option.

### <a name="sundar-gutka">What is Sundar Gutka?</a>

Sundar Gutka is a a list of frequently read Banis such as Sukhmani Sahib, Asa Kee Vaar, Nitnem, and many more. This list is avaialble within SikhiToTheMax for easy access rather than needing to search for each Bani. Simply click on the Sundar Gutka icon to get started. ![](./assets/img/help_images/SG.gif)

### <a name="bani-length">Why are some Banis in Sundar Gutka so short/long? How do I fix this?</a>

Throughout the past few centuries, there have been many different “sampardhas” or “jathas” that have been conceived from the core concepts of Sikhi and Gurmat. These sampardhas often have different opinions and thoughts about some aspects of Sikh history, Gurbani and Rehat, but still fall collectively under the united Khalsa Panth and, most importantly, the Akaal Takht. The Akaal Takht is the highest order and institution that all Sikhs adhere to.

These differences have also brought about different recommendations about compiled Baanis and the Paath (prayers) that we read on a daily basis which makes it difficult to create a single Sundar Gutka with a single version of Paath that would satisfy everyone.

We therefore have created the option to select lengths of what Paath you do that apply to four of the main Banis read most often. These have been structured in relation to length but all have a minimum of the SGPC standard or fall under the Akaal Takht. We do not include any versions that are by sampardhas excommunicated by the Akaal Takht as a standard.

For those who may be confused about which version to begin reading these Banis, we recommend reading the longest Bani because the more we read and recite, the better it is for our souls. However, for beginners, we would suggest to start with the “short” setting and change to increase the length setting in future once you are comfortable, confident and have more time.

Here is a breakdown of the lengths and which sampardhas typically use them:

SHORT: This is the minimum SGPC/Akaal Takht standard.

MEDIUM: Typically read by followers of the Akhand Keertani Jatha and others.

LONG: Typically read by followers of Damdami Taksaal and others.

EXTRA LONG: Most popular amongst followers of Buddha Dal.

You can adjust Bani Length in the Settings tab.

### <a name="vishraams">What are Vishraams?</a>

Vishraams indicate pauses in Gurbani. There are both long pauses and short pause that are denoted by different colors (see next question). It is important to note that Vishraams are interpretations from Gursikhs and are not written directly in Guru Granth Sahib Jee.

### <a name="vishraams-options">What are the Vishraam styles and sources?</a>

The Khalis team preformed a user study to determine the best way to display Vishraams. You have the option (in the Settings) to choose between Colored Words or a Gradient Background. Colors are defined below:

- Colored Text:

  - _Red_ - long pause
  - _Yellow_ - short pause

Additionally, you have the option to choose between Vishraam sources:

- Sources:
  - _BaniDB Living_ - Vishraams being actively updated/corrected by the BaniDB & Khalis Foundation team of sevaadaars
  - _iGurbani_ - Vishraams as shown in the iGurbani mobile app
  - _STTM 2_ - Vishraams as shown in the old SikhiToTheMax 2 app

### <a name="additional-info">Additional Database/Search Information</a>

- SikhiToTheMax's database includes shabads from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee, Sri Dasam Granth Sahib, Bhai Gurdas Jee, Bhai Gurdas Singh Jee, Bhai Nand Lal Jee, and various rehatnamas and thankhanamas. If your shabad is not from one of those sources, it will not appear.
- If you verified your shabad should be in the database and it is still not coming up, make sure you are typing in the correct letters for search. If you aren’t sure about a letter, or are still having difficulties, try using one of the different search types to locate the shabad.
- If you don't know one of the letters, consider using an asterisk in its place. Here's some information on how it works:
  - _First letter start_ -
    `ssnh` it will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” not “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
  - _First letter anywhere_ -
    `ssnh` it will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
  - _First letter start_ -
    `*ssnh` will search for “jat sat sanjam naam hai” and not “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar”
  - _First letter anywhere_ -
    `*ssnh` will search for “jat sat sanjam naam hai” and not “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar”
  - _First letter start_ -
    `ssnh*` will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and not “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
  - _First letter anywhere_ -
    `ssnh*` will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
  - _First letter start_ -
    `ss*nh` will search for “sukh sagar har naam hai” and neither “soche soch na hovayi..” nor “rasna sacha simriye man tan nirmal hoye”
  - _First letter anywhere_ -
    `ss*nh` will search for “sukh sagar har naam hai” and “rasna sacha simriye man tan nirmal hoye” but not “soche soch na hovayi…”

### <a name="bani-overlay">What is Bani Overlay?</a>
