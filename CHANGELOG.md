## SikhiToTheMax Desktop App

### 3.2.0 - _170526_
#### Improved
 * Faster updates - We've reduced the size of the app and subsequent updates by storing the database separately on your device. It now downloads on first run and saves you from re-downloading every time we update the app. When there are updates to the database, those will get pulled transparently and allow you to use the app without interruption.
